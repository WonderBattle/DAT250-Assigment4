# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 4 - Hand-in Report

## Project Overview
Successfully implemented persistence for the poll application using Java Persistence API (JPA) with Hibernate ORM and an H2 in-memory database. The application models polls, users, vote options, and votes with proper entity relationships. The implementation ensures data integrity through bidirectional mappings and cascading operations.


## Technical Problems Encountered and Solutions


### 1. **Entity ID Type Mismatch**

**Problem**: My project from Assigment 3 used `String` as entity IDs (set via UUIDs in `PollManager`), which conflicted with JPAâ€™s need for numeric auto-generated primary keys.

**Solution**: Changed all entity IDs from `String` to `Long` and annotated them as:

```java
@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
private Long id;
```

---

### 2. **Missing `poll` Field in `Vote`**

**Problem**: Hibernate reported:

```
Collection 'Poll.votes' is 'mappedBy' a property named 'poll' which does not exist
```

because the `Vote` entity lacked a back-reference to `Poll`.

**Solution**: Added the missing relationship:

```java
@ManyToOne
private Poll poll;
```

---

### 3. **Unmapped `VoteOption` â†” `Vote` Relationship**

**Problem**: Votes were not properly linked to vote options, preventing correct schema generation.

**Solution**: Established a bidirectional mapping:

```java
// In VoteOption.java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "votesOn", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
private Set<Vote> votes = new LinkedHashSet<>();

// In Vote.java
@ManyToOne
private VoteOption votesOn;
```

## Changes made to the base project

We started from a base project without persistence annotations and IDs defined as `String`.
To adapt the project to JPA, the following changes were applied:

### General

* Added **JPA annotations** (`@Entity`, `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, `@JoinColumn`) across the entity classes.
* Changed entity IDs from `String` to `Long` with **auto-generated values** using:

  ```java
  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  private Long id;
  ```
* Imported the necessary JPA classes from `jakarta.persistence.*`.

---

### Poll.java

* Added `@Entity` to mark the class as a JPA entity.
* Changed `id` field from `String` to `Long` with `@Id` and `@GeneratedValue`.
* Added two bidirectional relationships:

  ```java
  @OneToMany(mappedBy = "poll", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
  private Set<VoteOption> options = new HashSet<>();

  @OneToMany(mappedBy = "poll", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
  private Set<Vote> votes = new HashSet<>();
  ```

---

### VoteOption.java

* Added `@Entity`.
* Added `id` field with `@Id` and `@GeneratedValue`.
* Added relationship to `Poll`:

  ```java
  @ManyToOne
  private Poll poll;
  ```
* Added relationship to `Vote`:

  ```java
  @OneToMany(mappedBy = "votesOn", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
  private Set<Vote> votes = new LinkedHashSet<>();
  ```

---

### Vote.java

* Added `@Entity`.
* Added `id` field with `@Id` and `@GeneratedValue`.
* Added relationship to `VoteOption`:

  ```java
  @ManyToOne
  private VoteOption votesOn;
  ```
* Added relationship to `Poll`:

  ```java
  @ManyToOne
  private Poll poll;
  ```
---


## Test Scenario

The application supports the following scenario:

1. **User Creation**: A new user can be created with username and email.
2. **Poll Creation**: A user creates a poll with a question.
3. **Adding Vote Options**: Vote options can be added to the poll with proper `presentationOrder`.
4. **Voting**: A user can vote for one of the available options.
5. **Bidirectional Relationships**: Votes and polls are correctly linked to their users and options.
6. **Persistence Test**: Running `PollsTest` verifies that entities are created, persisted, and queried successfully.

ðŸ‘‰ In addition, the application also passes all the tests of the previous Assignments.

## Key Features Implemented

### âœ… Entity Annotations

* `@Entity` added to `Poll`, `VoteOption`, `Vote`, and `User`.
* `@Id` and `@GeneratedValue` for primary keys.

### âœ… Relationships

* **Poll â†” Vote**: One-to-many, mapped by `poll`.
* **Poll â†” VoteOption**: One-to-many, mapped by `poll`.
* **VoteOption â†” Vote**: One-to-many, mapped by `votesOn`.
* **Vote â†” VoteOption**: Many-to-one with join column `option_id`.
* **Vote â†” Poll**: Many-to-one with implicit join column `poll_id`.

### âœ… Database Schema

Hibernate automatically generated the following tables in H2:

* `poll`
* `vote_option`
* `vote`
* `user`

Foreign keys:

* `vote.poll_id â†’ poll.id`
* `vote.option_id â†’ vote_option.id`
* `vote_option.poll_id â†’ poll.id`


## Pending Issues

### 1. **Column Naming**

Currently relying on Hibernateâ€™s default column names. For production, explicit `@JoinColumn(name = "...")` annotations should be standardized.

### 2. **Validation**

No validation annotations (`@NotNull`, `@Size`) implemented yet for entity fields.

### 3. **Cascade Deletes**

Although cascading works for some relationships, deletion scenarios (e.g., removing a `Poll`) need more thorough testing.

### 4. **PollManager**

Still uses in-memory `HashMap` storage for certain operations. Full migration to JPA repositories would simplify persistence handling.



## Conclusion
The assignment was successfully completed with a fully working persistence layer for polls, vote options, and votes.
The main challenges involved adapting entity IDs from `String` to `Long`, fixing missing relationships, and setting up proper bidirectional mappings.

By resolving these, Hibernate correctly generated the database schema, and the provided test case passed.
This assignment provided valuable experience with JPA, Hibernate mappings, and schema inspection in H2.
